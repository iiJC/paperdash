## Auto reviewer

A simple easy to read spaced repetition viewer
Tells you what to study and when

If you input a topic (for example a lecture)
it will automatically schedule when you should be reviewing this lecture topic

- Has a view where it tells you everything you should be reviewing today (and tomorrow etc.)
- Within that view it ranks the priority of the review (eg you learnt this topic yesterday REVIEW IT FIRST before it expires)
  On this note, it displays topics in categories of priority - so the topics you learnt months ago, if reviewed properly, should be quicker/easier/faster to go through
  Can combine with the timer - if you run overboard on its allocated maybe it will adjust it's priority
