productivity


The system is modular - you can pick which features you want and don't want displayed (on the toolbar? or installed entirely?)
System is combined into one main dashboard app

Top 3 tasks on lock screen/home screen

Auto timer/period/event header

Calendar:
Easy view
Google/Outlook Sync, but simplified multiview
Auto Scheduler

Tracker/heatmap

## Auto reviewer
A simple easy to read spaced repetition viewer
Tells you what to study and when

If you input a topic (for example a lecture)
it will automatically schedule when you should be reviewing this lecture topic

- Has a view where it tells you everything you should be reviewing today (and tomorrow etc.)
- Within that view it ranks the priority of the review (eg you learnt this topic yesterday REVIEW IT FIRST before it expires)
  On this note, it displays topics in categories of priority - so the topics you learnt months ago, if reviewed properly, should be quicker/easier/faster to go through
  Can combine with the timer - if you run overboard on its allocated maybe it will adjust it's priority

## Timer
- Can count upwards to a mark
